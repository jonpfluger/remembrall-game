# Remembrall

## Description

This is a group project with a MERN Stack (MongoDb, Express.js, Reactjs, Node.js) development. Uses a GraphQL API with Apollo Server.

We wanted to make a game and we were inspired by the recent Harry Potter game release, so we decided to make our game Harry Potter themed.

## User Story

As a wizard/witch, I want to be able to play a Harry Potter themed memory card game, so that I can exercise my brain and test my memory while having fun.
